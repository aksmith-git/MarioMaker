# Progress

## Phase 1 — Environment and extraction (complete, awaiting go-ahead)

### Done
- Repo initialised; remote `aksmith-git/MarioMaker` (private). `.gitignore` excludes dumps, keys,
  extracted data and `research/`.
- Proprietary-content guard (`scripts/check_no_proprietary.py`) + tests + CI workflow + pre-commit hook.
- Toolchain installed and pinned outside the repo — see [docs/TOOLCHAIN.md](docs/TOOLCHAIN.md).
- `tools/inventory.py`: identifies extracted files by magic (through Yaz0/zstd), looks inside SARCs.
- **SMM1** (WUX disc image) decrypted with console common key + disc key:
  - `~/smm-work/extracted/smm1-disc/` — base game v16 (`000500001018DC00`)
  - `~/smm-work/extracted/smm1-update-v208/` — update v208 bundled on the disc
  - Detailed inventories: `research/inventory/` (private)

### SMM1 layout summary (base v16 + update v208)
| Area | Where | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Main executable | `code/Block.rpx` (v208: 9.0 MiB) | Wii U RPX (PPC, big-endian) |
| Course data | `content/Course/*.szs` (152: sample, tutorial, title, new) | Yaz0 → SARC → `.cdt` (SMM1 course) |
| Course thumbnails | `content/CourseThumbnail/*.szs` | Yaz0 → SARC → `.tnl` |
| Tilesets / scenery | `content/Model/M1_Field_*`, `M1_DV_*` etc. per style | Yaz0 → SARC → BFRES |
| Sprites / characters | `content/Model/*_Player_Chara_*`, `Pack/*.pack` | BFRES, SARC packs of Yaz0 SARCs |
| Per-style environments | `content/Pack/{M1,M3,MW,WU}_FieldEnv_{Normal,Dark,Water,Yogan}.pack` | SARC |
| Physics / object params | `Pack/*.pack` → `.params`, `.byaml` | text params, BYML (to be confirmed in Phase 3) |
| Text | `content/Message/*_USen.szs` | Yaz0 → SARC → MSBT |
| Layout / UI | `content/Layout/*.szs` | Yaz0 → SARC → SARC (BFLYT/BFLIM) |
| Music | `content/Sound/**/*.bfstm` (147) | BFSTM |
| SFX | `content/Sound/*.bars` (193), `Sound.pack` | BARS → BFWAV |

Styles: `M1` SMB1, `M3` SMB3, `MW` SMW, `WU` NSMBU. Themes: plain, underground, castle, airship,
water, haunted house.

- **SMM2** from `MarioMaker2.NSP` (owner's dump; v1.0.0, title `01009B90006DC000`, SDK 7.4.0, no update):
  - `~/smm-work/extracted/smm2-nsp/exefs/` — `main` (NSO, 17 MiB), `sdk`, `rtld`, `main.npdm`
  - `~/smm-work/extracted/smm2-romfs/` → symlink to `/Volumes/SSD/smm-work/extracted/smm2-romfs` (2.7 GiB; internal disk is full)
  - `SMM2.xci` is NOT used (it is the `[romstorage.com]` file renamed).
- **Course sample**: `tools/fetch_courses.py` pulled 550 courses into `~/smm-work/courses/mm2_level/`
  from the public `TheGreatRambler/mm2_level` dataset (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0): 25 per style x difficulty
  plus 50 extra SMB1 ground courses. All from June–July 2019 uploads, so they only use v1.0.0 content.
  All 550 decompress to 0x5BFC0 bytes and their headers (timer, style, name) match the metadata.

### SMM2 layout summary (v1.0.0)
| Area | Where | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Main executable | `exefs/main` | NSO (AArch64); Ghidra Switch Loader |
| Built-in courses | `Course/*.szs` (120 story `quest`, 50 `lesson`, 10 `title`) | Yaz0 → SARC → `.bcd` (to confirm in Phase 2 whether encrypted) |
| Online/save courses | (from dataset) | 0x5BFC0-byte decrypted course; on-console `.bcd` is encrypted |
| Tilesets / scenery | `Model/{M1,M3,MW,WU,3W}_Field_<theme>`, `_DV_` (background), `_S_DV_` | zstd → SARC → BFRES (+ BFSHA) |
| Theme animation | `Pack/<style>_FieldAnime_{Normal,Dark,Ice,Snow,Water,Yogan}.pack` | SARC |
| Sprites / objects | `Pack/<style>_Model.pack`, `Static*.pack`, `Model/` | SARC of zstd SARCs → BFRES |
| Params / physics candidates | `Pack/*.pack` → 423 BYML; `Bake/*.bkres` | BYML; SARC (to be mapped in Phase 3) |
| Text | `Message/*.szs` | Yaz0 → SARC → MSBT (3038) + MSBP |
| UI | `Layout/*.szs` | Yaz0 → SARC → SARC (BFLYT etc.) |
| Music & SFX | `Sound/Resource/**` (471 BWAV, 2.1 GiB), `Pack/<style>_bars.pack` | BWAV, BARS |
| Sound delay/env per theme | `Sound/Effect/delay_<style><theme>.byml` | BYML |

Styles: `M1` SMB1, `M3` SMB3, `MW` SMW, `WU` NSMBU, `3W` SM3DW. Themes: plain, underground, castle,
airship, water, hauntedhouse, snow, desert, athletic (sky), woods.

### Open
- SMM2 update (v3.0.x) not dumped. Courses made after Dec 2019 can use 2.0/3.0 items that v1.0.0 has
  no assets or code for. Needed before Phase 7 and for a realistic 100 Mario Challenge pool.
- Owner's own saved courses: not yet exported from the Switch; the dataset sample covers Phase 2 for now.
